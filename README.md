# Rocket_Sim

## Purpose:

This simulation was made in ~1 week to help me better understand orbital mechanics. It is a stepping stone to more advanced programs I want to work on for other things (Kerbal Space Program).
This simulation models the motion of one rocket/satellite in orbit around the Earth. The math is using real values and calculating orbits in realtime. The default values have a rocket orbiting at the approximate altitude of the ISS (400km).

## Using the Simulator:

### Controls:

Q - Slow Down Simulation
E - Speed Up Simulation

A - Rotate Rocket CW
D - Rotate Rocket CCW

Z - Zoom In
X - Zoom Out

R - Reset Speed and Scale

SPACE - Toggle Engine

### View:

Upper Left - Speed compared to realtime, and Scale of display

Lower Left - 
	Altitude in km above Earth's surface
    Angle in radians clockwise from 3 o'clock position
    Velocity magnitude in meters per second
    Periapsis (low pt in orbit) altitude in km above Earth's surface
    Apoapsis (high pt in orbit) altitude in km above Earth's surface
    True Anomaly Angle of Periapsis point from 3 o'clock position
    Eccentricity of orbit ellipse
